This is an app which can convert any image into recognised text.

The Snap Seeker app is a powerful tool that offers a convenient solution for performing text recognition from images. 
With this app, users can easily extract text from photos and then copy and edit it as needed. Whether you have a document, a sign, or any other text-based image, Snap Seeker can quickly analyze the content 
and convert it into editable text. By simply taking a picture or selecting an existing image from your device, the app's advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology recognizes the text within the image.
This enables you to effortlessly extract and utilize the information contained in the picture. Once the text has been extracted, Snap Seeker provides you with the ability to copy and paste the 
recognized text into any other application or document. Whether you want to transfer it to a note-taking app, share it via messaging, or edit it in your favorite word processing software,
Snap Seeker streamlines the process.
